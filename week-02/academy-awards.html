        <h1>Academy Awards</h1>

        <p>The Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit for the American film industry. 
        The awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel 
        with an audience of about 270 people.</p>

        <p>The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($79 at 2020 
        prices). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes. </p>
        
        <h2>Oscar Stattuete</h2>

        <p>The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated bronze on 
        a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34.3 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.856 kg), and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding 
        a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy:</p>
